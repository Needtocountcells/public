# Text replacement for Unicode symbols on Mac
Symbols not found on the main keyboard are time-consuming to track down. This is inconvenient for frequently used symbols, especially for applications requiring fast typing with many symbols, such as taking notes in a math lecture.

The MacOS Text Replacement feature https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/replace-text-punctuation-documents-mac-mh35735/mac offers a solution. By assigning strings unlikely to come up in normal typing to be replaced eith the desired symbol, the need to look up and copy-paste the symbol can be eliminated.
The "codes" used to generate each symbol can be arbitrary, but if you're familiar with LaTeX it's convenient to use LaTeX abbreviations o along with the convention of beginning with a backslash. For example, "\alpha" can be set to be autocorrected to "α", and "\check" can be autocorrected to the useful ✓.

Lists of text replacements can be exported and imported as described here: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/back-up-and-share-text-replacements-on-mac-mchl2a7bd795/mac 
This very simple repository (I'm not a software engineer or anything and don't know my wat around GitHub) provides a public list of abbreviations I've found useful in a decade of using this trick, which you can import following the instructions at the link if you'd like to use them on your device. They're mostly related to math classes in complex analysis and topology I took, along with some biology-related ones and miscellaneous.

If there's a way to suggest changes on GitHub (again, I'm a novice and have other things I should be doing), feel free to suggest others that might be helpful for a list like this. 
No need to credit me or anything, this isn't much of an intellectual breakthrough but I hope it's helpful to you!
